# 3.1.1
### Bugfixes
* Our new debugging framework sentry helped us to find and fix various runtime bugs and crashes (#148, #144, #147, #145, #146)

# 3.1.0

### Features
* List (mounted/unmounted) shares in menu bar and open the mounted directories when they are clicked. (#46, #122)
    * settable by MDM via boolean `showMountsInMenu` (default is to show mounts in menu `showMountsInMenu = true`)
* Every individual menu item can now be configured as hidden if needed (#122)
    * The following values can be set (via MDM)
         * menuAbout
         * menuConnectShares
         * menuDisconnectShares
         * menuCheckUpdates
         * menuShowSharesMountDir
         * menuShowShares
         * menuSettings
    * The above values can be set to either `disabled` (the menu item will be grayed out) or `hidden` (the menu item will be hidden).
* Local override of the %USERNAME%  (#130)
    * If the local username does not match the account name of a network share, an alternative username can be used instead (`usernameOverride`).
    * This option is intended less for configuration via MDM and more for local setting by a user through `plutil` or something similar.
* We are now using *Sentry* to collect issues and crash reports (#135, #131, #138)
    * It has become apparent that there are recurring errors that we cannot reproduce. Debugging such problems is often time-consuming.
    * We use a locally hosted instance of Sentry, not one hosted in the cloud. The data therefore never leaves our local servers hosted in our data center.
    * Since we have no interest in any user data, we only collect data that aids us in debugging.
    * We have introduced a new switch that turns off the collection and sending of analysis data. This switch cannot be set via MDM either. We believe that every user should be able to decide for themselves whether to support us with their crash reports.
    
### Bugfixes
* Fixed a bug where Finder can crash (#134)
* Fixed a bug where cusatoim network share were not editable (#137)
* Fixed two race conditions (one in our DogeAD library)
* Fixed a possible memory management crash in PreferenceManager.setADUserInfo (#142)

# 3.0.4

### Features
* Possibility introduced to **trigger mount** and **unmount** via UNIX signals (`kill -SIGUSR1 PID` performs an unmount of all shares, `kill -SIGUSR2 PID` triggers a mount of all shares)
* Mount status display now enhanced with SF Symbols.
* Integrated the widely used [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org/) framework so that the app can update itself. There is a new parameter `enableAutoUpdater` which is set to TRUE by default. If you want to deactivate the auto update feature, you must set this parameter to `false` (Issue #116)
* Possibility introduced to trigger mount and unmount via UNIX signals (kill -SIGUSR1 PID performs an unmount of all shares, kill -SIGUSR2 PID triggers a mount of all shares) (Issue #106)
* increased menu icon size
* *We are of the opinion that Kerberos functionality via our DogeADAuth library can leave the beta stage soon*

### Bugfixes
* Fixed two race conditions (one in our DogeAD library) (Issue #123 Issue #125)
* Fixed a bug where the color of the menu bar symbol did not reflect the status of the Kerberos ticket (kerberos authentication (dogeAuth) beta)
* Fixed a bug in a doge library (kerberos authentication) call which caused the app to crash
* Workaround for Finder showing already disconnected drives after wakeup (Issue #109)
* Fixed a few bug in external doge-ad kerberos authentication library which caused the app to crash after some time (Issue #113)

# 3.0.3

* Fixed a bug where mounts under `/Volumes` as default mount path generated `sharename-1` etc. directories
   * if there is already a directory with the same name as the share under `/Volumes`, the mount will be aborted. 
   * since the `/Volumes` directory is read-only for regular users, directories of aborted mounts (also known as "zombie" mount directories) cannot be deleted.
   * if such a directory exists, the share will not be mounted: **for the aforementioned reasons the *Network Share Mounter* is unable to solve the issue of stale directories under `/Volumes`**. 
   * Users with root privileges can manually delete these directories, while administrators can use scripts to delete them.
   * After a reboot of macOS, these directories will also be deleted.
* Fixed a bug where the color of the menu bar symbol did not reflect the status of the Kerberos ticket (kerberos authentication (dogeAuth) beta)

# 3.0.2

* Fixed a bug that caused the app to crash when the Mac wakes up from sleep
* if kerberos is enabled (Beta), user triggered *mount all shares* will also re-authenticate/renew Kerberos tickets.

# 3.0.1

* fixed migration of `FAU Prefix Assistant` account to NSM's keychain

# 3.0.0

*For usage and configuration examples please consult the [documentation](https://gitlab.rrze.fau.de/faumac/networkShareMounter/-/blob/dev/README.md?ref_type=heads)*

## Speed and Reliability
* Transition from *Grand Central Dispatch* (GCD) to *Swift Concurrency* for improved asynchronous task management.
* Mount operations are now executed in parallel (Issue #36).
* The issue of mounts "overtaking" themselves has been resolved.
* The occurrence of multiple mount directories (`SHARE-1, SHARE-2, ...`) has been eliminated, which used to happen when a mount became "outdated" (Issue #48, #66, #53).

## Network Shares
* Added a new internal data structure for shares.
	* The current "state" of a mount is recorded, including whether it should be mounted, is in the mount queue, is already mounted, or if an error has occurred.
	* Explicit mount points per share are now possible, instead of relying on a globally defined mount directory (Issue #60).
* Managed shares now support username/password authentication (Issue #54, #34).
* Improved authentication features: supports password authentication and MDM-defined network shares can now be handled in a more flexible manner.
* Users can choose between username/password or Kerberos authentication.
* The user-defined share credentials are now stored in the macOS Keychain.
* Network shares defined by MDM are now more flexible.

## Advanced Logging
* Detailed and clear logging capabilities implemented.
* All crucial operations now generate corresponding logs.

## Kerberos SSO
* Serves as a potential alternative to Apple Enterprise Connect, Jamf Connect or NoMAD with our new kerberos authentication library.
* If a Kerberos realm is configured, such as through a profile, the Network Share Manager can set and store the username and password for obtaining and renewing Kerberos tickets.
* Display different colors for the app icon in the menu to notify the user about missing or incorrect credentials.

## Additional Features
* If the user disconnects the drives by clicking the menu option, they will stay disconnected until:
  	* A network change, such as VPN or switching between home and office networks, happens.
	* The user remounts the drives manually using the menu.
* Shares can be mounted or unmounted during specific system events, such as network changes, system sleep, shutdown, and app quit.
* Support for `afp://` and webdav (`https://`) has been integrated.
* The app now consistently reflects changes made to the MDM profile (Issue #71).
* ...and a lot of bugfixes.

## System Requirements
* macOS 11 Big Sur or later.
